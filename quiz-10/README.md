This video consists of a presentation at a Dropbox developer conference in 2013. The way that the presenter goes about his message is by pretending to be giving a presentation about "the future of programming" as though
the current year was 1973 and not 2013. His major point in the beginning is that while tech itself changes quickly, the minds and thinking behind the utilization are resistant to adaptation. As programming went from writing binary
to writing assembly language to writing a proper programming language like FORTRAN, coputer scientists from the previous phase were resistant and unwilling to adapt to a new way of thinking. He then moves onto his
4 "major ideas" that he "believes we will transition to" in the "next 40 years". The point of each idea is to list the current standard and make a prediction about the direction it will go. These categories are
coding, procedures, text dump, and sequential instruction. He "believes" that coding will transition into direct data manipulation, procedures will transform into goals and constraints where the computer figures
out how to solve the problem to the constraints itself, a text dump of code to a more spatial representation, and the sequential model of programming to a concurrent parallel programming model on parallel processor systems.
During each of these points, he makes a comment about how a technology, that in reality is very releavnt today, is a dead-end and we need to move on from it (e.g. markup and styling languages, API's, code in text files, and threads and locks).
He then comes around to the overarching point of the presentation, which is that it is necessary to evolve the ideas of programming, and it is necessary to always remember to try new ways of programming. Overall, it is better to
admit that we don't have any idea what we are doing, because it will motivate us to keep looking for new ways to evolve the field and innovate more efficient methods of programming. At the same time, there is no way to predict
the future of the industry and as such, we should be open to all ideas.
